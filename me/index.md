# Hi

* My name is Vismay. I'm a PhD student at the University of Toronto advised by Professor David Levin. My research interests are in physics based simulation. My hobbies are running, gardening, and recently kettlebell workouts. Currently I'm working on a crowd simulator with anticipatory collision avoidance, and also working as a TA for [CSC417] Physics Based Simulations. More needs to be added later.

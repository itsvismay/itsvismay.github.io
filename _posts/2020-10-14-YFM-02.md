## Yale Financial Markets Lecture 2
 
 Model
- Exogenous variables $e$ (incontrollable variables)
- Endogenou variables $x$ (prices, consumption, predictable variables)
- Equilibrium conditions $F(e,x) = 0$
- Equilibrium $x(e)$ s.t. $F(e, x(e)) = 0$
- Comparative Statics -> what happens when you change $e$.

Why models?

* Prediction, understanding
* Properties of equil

> Ricardo: first economic model- principle of comparative advantage.
> Malthus: Models are based on assumptions, which propagate errors

Market Mechanisms

* Seller determined prices 
* Haggling
* Govt price regulation
* Paris Bourse - tatonnement
* Commodities futures pit
* Bid/Ask prices

NYSE Beginnings
* Founded in 1792 by 24 brokers on wall stree
* Only 5 securities traded. 3 war bonds, 2 bank stocks
* Sold in a double auction format

Walrus 1871
* Marginal utility
* Utility increases with more stuff but at smaller and smaller rate.

Endowments (what do I have?)
* $x$ is money
* $y$ is goods

## General Equilibrium Model

**Exogenous Variables**

* Individual $i \epsilon I$ where each $i$ has a utility and an endowment
    * Welfare $W_i(x, y) = u_i(x) + v_i (y)$ 
        * $y$ is money
        * $x$ is football tickers
    * Endowment $e_i = (e_{ix}, e_{iy})$

**Endogenous Variables**

* Prices $(P_x, P_y)$
* Trades, or final 
consumptions $(x, y)$

**Equilibrium**

$$F(e, x) = 0$$

Budget set of agent $i$ is the linear trade-off between $x, y$ defined by:

$$P_x(x^i - e_{ix}) + P_y(e_{iy} - y^i) = 0$$

Final consumption must equal final endowment.

General Equilibrium for 2 agents:
1. $\sum_i x_i = \sum_i e_{ix}
2. $\sum_i y_i = \sum_i e_{iy}
3. $P_x(x^i - e_{ix}) + P_y(e_{iy} - y^i) = 0$
4. $P_x(x^j - e_{jx}) + P_y(e_{jy} - y^j) = 0$
5. $\frac{MarginalUtility_i(x)}{MarginalUtility_i(y)} = \frac{P_x}{P_y}$
6. $\frac{MarginalUtility_j(x)}{MarginalUtility_j(y)} = \frac{P_x}{P_y}$
